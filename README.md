The Marketing Mix Modelling (MMM) Project for Amplifyd
Project title: Marketing mix modeling (MMM) in Digital Marketing

Client background:

Amplifyd (Website: amplifyd.co.uk) was founded in 2016 to help companies grow their business online. Our tailored and results-focussed approach ensures that all clients get the best service within their budget. From emerging start-ups to global retailers, we have a proven track record of helping clients accelerate their online growth. We focus firmly on delivering data quality, more conversions, more sales leads and more revenue for less spend.

A team of 21 performance marketeers, analysts & developers who worked with some of the world’s largest advertisers and have now established a successful ‘test & scale’ framework after helping more than 60 scale-ups grow.  We deliver sustainable growth and ensure time efficiencies which allows our clients to invest their budget elsewhere as opposed to building, training and maintaining a team in house. Our team includes a diverse skill set under one roof; strategy, optimizations, scaling, analytics, scripts & automations and creative production.

We aim to be a trusted advisor while offering a proper structured digital acquisition strategy combined with ongoing management to ensure that the multitude of moving pieces are working like clockwork and in tandem. We are performance-driven and we measure ourselves by the results we achieve for our partners.

Project background and Requirement: 
In this challenging landscape and with all privacy-related changes, it becomes harder and hard to evaluate the marketing efforts of a business. Moreover the success is usually tied to hard metrics like financial results and marketing teams find it more challenging to prove the value of their work.

Marketing mix models (MMM) help marketers make apples-to-apples comparisons across all of their different investments. They provide answers to questions like: What drove sales? What was my ROI? How do I optimize my marketing investment?

This project's objective is to leverage the most granular data from our publishing partners and build an MMM model to report each channel's ROI with an accepted level of statistical confidence.

What is involved for the students? 
The student(s) will be an active part of our team to help define the structure of the dataset, build the appropriate models, and evaluate the results. Through this project they will be able to apply all the theoretical knowledge they gathered so far in a real-life project and see how statistical models and data can affect business decisions. They will research and experiment with different types of statistical models, their data requirements and how they can be evaluated. The ideal student has a strong knowledge over statistics and familiarity in designing and applying statistical models. Programming experience is not required but will be highly appreciated.
